### Some Context:
[This App](https://yousefbarakat99-streamlit-streamlitsapp-2b4ckt.streamlit.app/) explores the relation between price, size and number of rooms along a relatively large dataset. The data was scraped from 2 property websites in the area that I live in. The motivation behind this project was to try and find a solution to easily having a large excel file with properties and filtering them while having an easily accessable link that leads directly to the posting after hearing a friend who was complaining about finding a property to rent because going through several website and interfaces was a waste of time.
